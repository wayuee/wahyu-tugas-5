I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, Ive successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”",

          "“ Before joining the bootcamp, Ive never written a line of code. I needed structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, Ive often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!",

The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
